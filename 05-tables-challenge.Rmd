# Tables

Using the data set from the reference lab of PNW flights, choose three analytical questions from the menu below, and design a  table for each one that answers it in a publication-ready format (using your choice of table library), including appropriate column names, etc. Unless otherwise specified, all questions should be explored for flights departing from Portland. Alternatively, please feel free to come up with your own analyses!

- Which airlines had the _best_ and _worst_ track records of on-time departures in each month? Is it different between PDX and SEA?
- Which airlines _improved_ the most in terms of on-time departures over time, and on which routes? Which airlines got worse?
- What cities have the most service from Portland (defined however you like, but do make sure to define it clearly!), and which have the worst?
- By month, what new routes were added or removed? 
  - _Hint_: I haven't tried this one, but dplyr's `lead` and `lag` commands could be helpful
- Finding busy aircraft (identified by `tailnum`), with "business" defined as:
  - Which specific aircraft (`tailnum`) are seen most often, for whom do they fly, and on what routes?
  - Which specific aircraft accumulate the most _flight time_?
  - Which specific aircraft log the most _distance_?
- Descriptive statistics comparing several characteristics of long-haul vs. short-haul routes (defined however you like, but you must be clear about your definition)
  - the `air_time` column will be useful here
- Time of Day: are some destinations from PDX "morning" destinations vs "evening" ones? 


Make sure to keep in mind the design principles that we discussed on Monday regarding spacing, use of rules, row-vs-column orientation, alignment, etc., and provide a short description of your design and its motivation.

# Fonts

Spend some time on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) (or a different font repository) and pick out a serif, sanserif, and display font that "speaks to you". Write a sentence or two about each one, including what sort of scenario you think it would work well for.
